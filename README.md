# TIc-Tac-Toe

Minimax Algorithm :
The MiniMax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory. Considering that the opponent is also playing optimally, it gives a move that is optimal for the player. This method is frequently used in artificial intelligence (AI) games like chess, tic-tac-toe, and several double players games.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this algorithm, two players play the game; one is called ‘MAX’, and the other is ‘MIN.’ The goal of players is to minimize the opponent’s benefit and maximize self-benefit. The MiniMax algorithm conducts a depth-first search to explore the complete game tree and then proceeds down to the leaf node of the tree, then backtracks the tree using recursive calls.
